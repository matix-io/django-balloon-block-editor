## Building CKEditor

The `ckeditor5-build` folder was pulled out of the main CKEditor repo (https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5) from the `packgaes/ckeditor5-build-balloon-block` folder.

To build it, there is a script `build_ckeditor5.sh`. That will run everything including npm installation. Just make sure you have a node setup in your path. It was originally built using node v10.16.3 and npm v6.9.0.
